# agent-friend examples

Ready-to-run scripts showing agent-friend in real workflows.

## Setup

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/0-co/agent-friend.git"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...  # free at openrouter.ai (no credit card)
```

## Examples

### `ollama_quickstart.py` — local tool calling with Ollama (no API key)

The fastest way to get tool calling working with a local LLM. Defines 3 tools with `@tool`, runs them through qwen2.5:3b, shows cross-format export.

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
pip install openai  # needed for Ollama's OpenAI-compatible API
python3 examples/ollama_quickstart.py
```

No API key. No cloud. Zero cost. The same `@tool` functions export to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and MCP.

### `voice_briefing.py` — daily news spoken aloud

Searches for a topic, fetches top articles, summarizes, and speaks the result.

```bash
python3 examples/voice_briefing.py
python3 examples/voice_briefing.py --topic "Python packaging 2026"
python3 examples/voice_briefing.py --no-voice  # text only
```

Requires TTS: `espeak` (Linux), `say` (macOS), or set `AGENT_FRIEND_TTS_URL` for neural voices.

### `news_briefing.py` — read your RSS feeds and get a briefing

Subscribe to feeds, fetch latest items, and summarize them with the agent.

```bash
# Quick one-shot
agent-friend --tools rss "subscribe to https://news.ycombinator.com/rss as hn, then read me the top 5 stories"

# Or in Python
python3 -c "
from agent_friend import Friend
f = Friend(tools=['rss', 'memory'], api_key='sk-or-...')
f.chat('subscribe to https://news.ycombinator.com/rss as hn')
print(f.chat('read me the top 5 stories from hn and summarize each in one sentence').text)
"
```

### `research_assistant.py` — research any topic, save to markdown

Searches, fetches sources, writes a structured markdown summary, saves to file, remembers it.

```bash
python3 examples/research_assistant.py "LLM agent memory systems"
python3 examples/research_assistant.py "Python async patterns" --output report.md
python3 examples/research_assistant.py --depth quick "AI agent tools"
```

---

### `task_manager.py` — conversational task manager with SQLite database

Creates a SQLite database, inserts tasks, queries by status. Shows both the Python API (no LLM needed) and the agent API.

```bash
# Python API only (no API key needed)
python3 examples/task_manager.py

# With agent (conversational)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
python3 examples/task_manager.py
```

The Python API demo works with zero config — no API key, no external services.

---

---

### `custom_tools.py` — register any Python function as an agent tool

Use the `@tool` decorator to turn any function into an agent tool — stock prices, internal APIs, custom data lookups. Type hints become the JSON schema automatically.

```bash
python3 examples/custom_tools.py
```

```python
from agent_friend import Friend, tool

@tool
def stock_price(ticker: str) -> str:
    """Get current stock price for a ticker symbol."""
    return f"{ticker}: $182.50"  # call your real API here

friend = Friend(tools=["search", stock_price])
friend.chat("What's the AAPL stock price?")
```

Functions remain callable normally — `@tool` adds tool registration without changing the function.

---

### `git_commit_agent.py` — an AI that reads and commits to git repos

Combines GitTool + CodeTool + FileTool. Can read git status, view diffs, understand changes, and commit with descriptive messages. Interactive REPL.

```bash
python3 examples/git_commit_agent.py
python3 examples/git_commit_agent.py --repo /path/to/your/project
```

```
Agent ready. Ask me to review commits, understand changes, or commit code.
Examples:
  'What changed in the last 3 commits?'
  'Show me what changed in src/ since the last commit'
  'Stage all changes to tests/ and commit with a good message'
```

---

## Full demo scripts

The root directory also contains:

- `demo_live.py` — interactive REPL showing tool calls in real time
- `demo_briefing.py` — daily briefing with email + search + memory
- `demo.ipynb` — Colab notebook with 12 demos (no install required)
